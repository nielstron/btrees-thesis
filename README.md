# A Verified Implementation of Imperative B-trees

This repository contains the latex source code of the bachelors
thesis "A Verified Implementation of Imperative B-trees" by Niels MÃ¼ndler.

The document is derived from the great [TUM thesis template by Florian Walcher and contributors](https://github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex).
It includes several useful additions regarding support for the Isabelle
language in both mathematical expressions (see `settings.tex`)
and as code listings (see `lstsemantic.tex`).
The latter extends [the language script by Christoph Lange](https://github.com/clange/latex).
