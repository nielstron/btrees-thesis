I want to thank my supervisor Tobias Nipkow for introducing me to
Isabelle and the world of computer-assisted proofs through his lectures.
Further I am very grateful to Dr. Peter Lammich for his patient
and thorough introduction into the framework for separation logic proofs in Isabelle.

Im am especially grateful for the unconditional support of my parents,
and to my father,
for sparking and nurturing my interest in the natural sciences
and never ending technical discussions.
