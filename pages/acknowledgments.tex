I want to thank my Tobias Nipkow for introducing me to
Isabelle and the world of computer-assisted proofs in his lectures
Further I am very grateful to Dr. Peter Lammich for his patient
and thorough introduction into his framework for proofs on Imperative
programs in Isabelle.
A very special thank you goes to my parents for their unconditional support,
and to my father specifically
for sparking and nurturing my interest in the natural science
and never ending technical discussions.
