In this thesis, we use the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL \parencite{DBLP:books/sp/NipkowPW02}
to verify an imperative implementation of the classical B-tree data structure \parencite{DBLP:journals/acta/BayerM72}.
The implementation supports set membership and insertion queries
with efficient binary search for intra-node navigation.
This is accomplished by first specifying the structure abstractly 
in the functional modeling language HOL and proving functional correctness.
Using manual refinement, we derive an imperative implementation
in Imperative/HOL \parencite{DBLP:conf/tphol/BulwahnKHEM08}.
We show the validity of this refinement using
the separation logic utilities from the
Isabelle Refinement Framework \parencite{DBLP:journals/jar/Lammich19}. 
The code can be exported to the programming languages SML and Scala.
We examine the runtime of all operations indirectly by reproducing results
of the logarithmic relationship between height and the number of nodes.
Considering development time and lines of code,
our approach compares well to other approaches at mechanized
verifications of the B-tree data structure.
